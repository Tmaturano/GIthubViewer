# Github Repository Viewer
GithubViewer came up during my studies of Xamarin and its idea is simple and straightforward: Show a list of repositories from a specific user!

#####Need Internet Connection for utilization.

##How to use:

* Sign in to Github Repository Viewer with your Github Login.
* Enter the user name and then click "Search", the app will automatically load the repositories from the user entered as well as other informations
such as the name, location, etc.
* Scroll down to load more repositories asynchrony(the github API supplies 30 repositories as default per request).
* You can also find a specific repository in the recent searched list.

This app is following the MVVM Pattern and is using the github API, but there's still need for improvements, mainly regarding the layout and the architecture.

It's still under development, so some features will come up.

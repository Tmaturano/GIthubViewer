# GithubViewer
GithubViewer came up during my studies of Xamarin and its idea is simple and straightforward: Show a list of repositories from a specific user!

How to use:

* Enter the user name and then click "Search", the app will automatically load the repositories from the user entered as well as other informations
such as the name, location, etc.
* You can also find a specific repository in the recent searched list.

This app is following the MVVM Pattern and is using the github API, but there's still need for improvements, mainly regarding the layout and the architecture.

It's still under development, so some features will come up.
